Here is a comparison of `child_process.spawn()` and `exec` in

Node.js

Node.js

Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting.

Typescript

TypeScript

TypeScript is a free and open-source high-level programming language developed by Microsoft that adds static typing with optional type annotations to JavaScript. It is designed for the development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript.

:

child_process.spawn()

-   Spawns a new process from scratch.
-   Returns a stream that can be used to read and write data to the child process.
-   Does not require a
    shell
    Shell
    In computing, a shell is a computer program that exposes an operating system's services to a human user or other programs. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface or graphical user interface, depending on a computer's role and particular operation.

    environment.
-   Can be used to run any type of command, including shell commands and Node.js scripts.

exec

-   Executes a command in a child process.
-   Returns a
    buffer
    Data buffer
    In computer science, a data buffer is a region of a memory used to store data temporarily while it is being moved from one place to another. Typically, the data is stored in a buffer as it is retrieved from an input device or just before it is sent to an output device.

    containing the output of the command.
-   Requires a shell environment.
-   Can only be used to run shell commands.

Node.js

-   Both `child_process.spawn()` and `exec` can be used in Node.js.
-   `child_process.spawn()` is more flexible and powerful than `exec`, but it is also more complex to use.
-   `exec` is simpler to use, but it is less flexible and powerful than `child_process.spawn()`.

Express

-   Both `child_process.spawn()` and `exec` can be used in Express.
-   `child_process.spawn()` is more commonly used in Express because it is more flexible and powerful.
-   `exec` can be used in Express, but it is less commonly used because it is less flexible and powerful.

Typescript

-   Both `child_process.spawn()` and `exec` can be used in Typescript.
-   `child_process.spawn()` is more commonly used in Typescript because it is more flexible and powerful.
-   `exec` can be used in Typescript, but it is less commonly used because it is less flexible and powerful.

Conclusion

Overall, I recommend using `child_process.spawn()` over `exec` in Node.js, Express, and Typescript. `child_process.spawn()` is more flexible and powerful, and it can be used to run any type of command, including shell commands and Node.js scripts.

the spawn() child process returns the message module data every 1 second for 5 seconds, because the data is 'streamed' the exec() child process returns one message only module data module data module data module data module data after 5 seconds (when the process is closed) this is because the data is 'buffered'
