### **Node.js**

Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting.

### **Express.js**

Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.

**you can follow these steps**:

-   Import the `process` module.
-   Get the current URL using the `process.cwd()` method.
-   Open the browser instance using the `child_process.exec()` method.
-   Pass the URL to the browser instance as an argument.
-   Perform the corresponding logic in the Node Express TypeScript application.

**Here is an example of how to do this**:

Execution output

```typescript
import express from 'express';
import child_process from 'child_process';

const app: express.Express = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
	const url = process.cwd();
	child_process.exec(`open ${url}`);

	// Perform the corresponding logic here
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
	console.log('Server is listening on port 3000');
});
```

When you visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, the browser will open the current working directory. You can then perform the corresponding logic in the Node Express TypeScript application.

Here are some additional tips for using the current process() and direct current browser instance to a URL and then perform the corresponding logic in Node Express TypeScript:

-   You can use the `process.env` variable to get the
    environment variables
    Environment variable
    An environment variable is a user-definable value that can affect the way running processes will behave on a computer. Environment variables are part of the environment in which a process runs.

-   You can use the `child_process.spawn()` method to spawn a new child process.
-   You can use the `child_process.fork()` method to fork a new child process.
-   You can use the `child_process.execFile()` method to execute a file.
